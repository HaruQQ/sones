====== Basic datatypes ======


The GraphDB comes with a bunch of datatypes you can use as type for your attributes type definition.
Usable are following .NET base types.

===== Char =====
''Char'' is usable for all characters marked with ' .
<code csharp>
CREATE VERTEX TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (String Name, Char Sign)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (Name = 'new name', Sign = 'N')
</code>

=====  String =====
''String'' is useable for all text marked with ' .
<code csharp>
CREATE VERTEX TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (String Name)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (Name = 'new name')
</code>

===== Byte =====
''Byte'' is useable for numbers. It's an 8-bit unsigned integer.
<code csharp>
CREATE VERTEX TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (Byte Difference)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (Difference = 20)
</code>

===== Single =====
''Single'' is useable for single-precision floating-point number.
<code csharp>
CREATE VERTEX TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (Single Number)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (Number = 1.5)
</code>

===== Int16 / Int32 / Int64 =====
''Integer'' is useable for all numbers.
<code csharp>
CREATE VERTEX TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (Int64 Difference)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (Difference = -20)
</code>
Beside //Int64// also //Int32//, //Int16// are useable.


===== UInt16 / UInt32 / UInt64 =====
''UnsignedInteger'' is useable for all positive numbers.
<code csharp>
CREATE VERTEX TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (UInt64 Age)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (Age = 832847937252)
</code>
Beside //UInt64// also //UInt32//, //UInt16// are useable.

=====  Double =====
''Double'' is useable for all floating point numbers.
<code csharp>
CREATE VERTEX TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (Double Size)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (Size = 12.6)
</code>


=====  DateTime =====
''DateTime'' is useable for all datetime values. 
On insert use the en-us format mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss.
<code csharp>
CREATE TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (DateTime Born)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (Born = '12/31/2009 10:05:00')
</code>


=====  Boolean =====
''Boolean'' is useable for all truth values and flags.
<code csharp>
CREATE VERTEX TYPE myType ATTRIBUTES (Boolean IsSet)
INSERT INTO myType VALUES (IsSet = 'true')
