====== Ontology type system ======

The type system is designed in an ontological way to be able to create a network of types that are related to each other. This brings the following advantages:
  - A type can be derived from another one to be able to use its attributes
  - Attributes of a type are able to point to other types with no respect to their own location within the hierarchy
  - Hierarchical organization of knowledge

           Abstract ->
                      Language
                      GeneralTerm
                      ...
           Happening ->
                       Event
                       Situation
                       ...
