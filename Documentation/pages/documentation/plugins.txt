====== Plug-Ins and Extensions ======

The plugin system of the GraphDS will give you the opportunity to add new functions, indices etc. at any time. Currently, they will be loaded during the start-up time of the GraphDS – changes during the lifetime won’t be reflected.
Currently, each .dll and .exe file from the startup directory will be picked up and searched for any listed base type and interface. To add a new plugin just copy the .dll into the start-up directory and start the GraphDS.

**Please note that the base type or interface you implement must match the version of the GraphDS which will use the plugin!**
