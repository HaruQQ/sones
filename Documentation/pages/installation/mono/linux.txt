====== How to download and compile GraphDB ======

  - Check if the installed MONO version suits the requirements by running this on the commandline:
    - <code>mono --version</code>
    - The result should look like this:
      - <code>Mono JIT compiler version 2.10.1 (tarball Fri Feb 25 15:56:49 MST 2011)</code>
    - when there is a version greater than 2.8 you're ready to go - best results will be achieved with versions greater than 2.10

    - Download directly from the git repository
      - Install git on your machine - how to do this please refer to the installation information on http://git-scm.com/
      - you can download the source code using the command
        - <code>git clone git://github.com/sones/sones.git</code>
      - you will have a sones folder containing the source code when everything completed successfully
      - cd to that folder and run
      - <code>./buildSolution.sh</code>
      - this will build sones GraphDB
    - Download a current code tarball
      - https://github.com/sones/sones/tarball/master
