====== sones GraphDB Wiki and Documentation ======

The sones GraphDB is an object-ori­en­tated graph data storage for a large amount of highly con­nected semi-struc­tured data in a dis­trib­uted envi­ron­ment. In con­trast to clas­si­cal rela­tional but also purely object ori­en­tated data­bases this implies two very impor­tant con­se­quences: First its main focus is no longer the data, objects or ver­tices itself, but their (type-safe) inter­con­nec­tions or edges. This means we are inter­ested in the name of an user within a large scale social net­work, but we are much more inter­ested to know which films his friends-friends watched last sum­mer and thought that they were amaz­ing. In the near future we will pro­vide a large frame­work of graph algo­rithms for these prob­lems and usage scenarios. 

Since it's build upon the .NET Framework and Mono it can run on Windows, Linux, OSX and other Unixes.
