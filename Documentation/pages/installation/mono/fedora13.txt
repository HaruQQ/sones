====== How-To compile and install sones GraphDB 1.1 on Fedora 13 ======

This short how-to will show how one can compile and install the sones GraphDB on a plain vanilla Fedora 13 installation.

===== Installing Mono =====

Currently you need to compile your own version of Mono - the .NET Runtime environment for linux. To do this you can start by installing the latest stable version of Mono (when this is written it's the 2.6.4 version)

To download the latest stable version of Mono on Fedora you should do this (as root):

  * on x64
<code>
yum install mono-core.x86_64
</code>
  * on x86
<code>
yum install mono-core
</code>

===== Installing Pre-Requisites =====

You will need several tools to be installed in order to successfully compile Mono and sones GraphDB on your machine. You will need to have:

  * you need some tools to successfully compile Mono:
    * //autoconf//, * //make// (or //automake//), //g++// (or //gcc-c++//), //libtool//, //bison//, //gettext//, //perl-XML-Parser//, //git-core//
      * use the commandline (as root): 
<code>
yum install autoconf automake make g++ gcc gcc-c++ libtool bison gettext perl-XML-Parster git-core
</code>


===== Compiling Mono from Source =====

  * You need to get the source code from the Mono source server. The Mono project uses GitHub (GIT) for this purpose
    * To download the current Mono trunk source code from their source code server use this command:
<code>
git clone git://github.com/mono/mono.git
</code>
  * before compilation you want to create a directory where the new compiled mono drop will be installed - for example:
<code>mkdir /opt/mono </code>
  * After you successfully downloading the source code you need to go to the //mono// directory and run the 
  * following command to start the configuration process:
    * the parameters //with-large-heap// and //with-profile4// are necessary for sones GraphDS
    * the parameter //prefix// controls where the successful compiled mono will be installed, you can virtually set it to any directory you want 
<code>./autogen.sh --with-large-heap=yes --with-profile4=yes --prefix=/opt/mono</code>
  * After the successful completion of the configuration process you need to start the compiling process by running the simple command:
<code>make</code>
    * In some rare cases it might be necessary to use this command line to build mono:
      * http://code.google.com/p/mono-sh4/issues/detail?id=13
<code>make ASSEMBLED_DOCS= ; make ASSEMBLED_DOCS= install</code>
  * After the successful completion of the compiling process you can install Mono into the specified directory on your system by typing (eventually using sudo):
<code>make install</code>

  * in order to make use of this newest compiled version of Mono you need to set some environmental variables correctly, this can be done using a small shell script. You basically run this script before you compile or run the sones GraphDB in the next steps:
    * as you can see below the current Mono prefix is set to /opt/mono (as suggested above) - you need to change that to the path you installed mono in
<code>
#!/bin/bash

MONO_PREFIX=/opt/mono
GNOME_PREFIX=/usr
export DYLD_LIBRARY_FALLBACK_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_FALLBACK_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/include:$GNOME_PREFIX/include
export ACLOCAL_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/share/aclocal
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig:$GNOME_PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig
export PATH=$MONO_PREFIX/bin:$PATH
PS1="[mono] \w @ "
bash
</code>

===== Compiling sones GraphDB with Mono =====

You have several options which source code of the sones GraphDB you want to use. Option number 1 is you use the current GitHub repository by using this command line: 

<code>
git clone git://github.com/sones/sones.git
</code>

This command line will download all current source code from the sones Git (which is a source control software) Repository. After downloading you run the above script to change the environment variables so use the new mono build and after that you can use the //./build_Solution.sh// script to actually build the sones GraphDB on your machine.

The other option would be to download a source code tar.gz file which contains all source code necessary. These files are available [[http://github.com/sones/sones/downloads|here]].

===== Running with Mono =====

In order to run a compiled assembly you need to pass the version of the framework Mono should use on the command line. Like this:

<code>
 mono --runtime=v4.0.30319 sonesExample.exe
</code>
