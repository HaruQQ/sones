====== Aggregates ======
Aggregates are functions which works on the result set. That means, that the whole result is aggregated in opposit to a function which works on each single result.

===== Restrictions =====
There are some restrictions for aggregates.
  * they works only on single attributes like ''User.Age'' eg: ''AVG(User.Age)''
  * only level 0 attributes are currently allowed, aggregates like ''AVG(User.Friends.Age)'' are not allowed
  * aggregates on list attributes are treated as [[documentation:database:functions|functions]] e.g. ''COUNT(User.Friends)'' is a [[documentation:database:functions|function]] and force a different syntax
  * each selected attribute must be aggregated or grouped if at least one attribute is aggregated or grouped

===== Current aggregates =====
Currently provided aggregates:

==== Avg ====
The AVG aggregate returns the average value of a numeric column or any user defined type.
<code>FROM User u SELECT AVG(u.Age)</code>
==== Count ====
The COUNT aggregate returns the number of values (NULL values will not be counted) of the specified column.
<code>FROM User u SELECT COUNT(u.Age)</code>
==== Max ====
The MAX aggregate returns the largest value of the selected column.
<code>FROM User u SELECT MAX(u.Age)</code>
==== Min ====
The MAX aggregate returns the smallest value of the selected column.
<code>FROM User u SELECT MIN(u.Age)</code>
==== Sum ====
The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column or any user defined type.
<code>FROM User u SELECT SUM(u.Age)</code>

===== Userdefined aggregates =====
You can create your own aggregates by creating a public class which derives the //ABaseAggregate// class. All classes marked as private won't be added to the Database as aggregate.
