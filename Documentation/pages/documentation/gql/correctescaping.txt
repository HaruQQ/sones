====== Correct String Escaping ======

There are several cases when you are working with String values when you need to know how to correctly escape a character within that string. 

First there's a list of reserved characters which are interpreted by the Query Language itself:

===== String Delimiters =====

  * to delimit a String use: ' ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII|ASCII]] 0x27) or " ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII|ASCII]] 0x32)
    * This delimiter needs to be escaped in order to be used within a value


==== Example ====
<code SQL>
Name = 'theName'
</code>

or 

<code SQL>
Name = "theName"
</code>

=== Wrong ===

<code SQL>
Name = 'the'Name'
</code>

=== Correct ===

<code SQL>
Name = 'the\'Name'
</code>

or

<code SQL>
Name = "the'Name"
</code>


===== Path Separator \ =====

  * the character \ ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII|ASCII]] 0x5c) is used to escape other characters, if you want to use the character itself you have to double-escape it

==== Example ====

<code SQL>
FSURL = 'folder1\\folder2'
</code>
