====== GraphQL Overview ======

The sones Graph Query Lan­guage (GraphQL) allows you to cre­ate, mod­ify, and query a graph (data­base) and invoke admin­stra­tive com­mands. This domain spe­cific lan­guage (DSL) was cre­ated in order to sim­plify your switch-over from clas­si­cal rela­tional and object ori­en­tated data­bases, but also to max­i­mize the porta­bil­ity and main­tain­abilty of both our and your source code.
