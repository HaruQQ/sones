====== Tuple ======

A tuple is an ordered list of expressions surrounded by brackets.

===== Syntax =====

TUPLE = LEFTBRACKETSYMBOL [[documentation:database:querylanguage:expression|EXPRESSION]] [, [[documentation:database:querylanguage:expression|EXPRESSION]] ] RIGHTBRACKETSYMBOL

LEFTBRACKETSYMBOL = ( | [

RIGHTBRACKETSYMBOL = ) | ]

===== Examples =====

INSERT INTO Flower VALUES (Colors = SETOF//(Name = 'red', Name = 'black')//, Name = 'rose')

In this case a tuple is used to define references to other objects. It consists of two [[documentation:database:querylanguage:expression:binexpression|binary expressions]].

----

FROM User SELECT * WHERE Age INRANGE //[17, 22]//

FROM User SELECT * WHERE Age INRANGE //(17, 22]//

A tuple can be used to define an interval for the [[documentation:database:querylanguage:expression:operators|INRANGE]] operator. The first example defines an interval inclusive its lower and upper boundaries. The secord example defines an interval which excludes the lower and includes the upper boundary.

----

FROM User U SELECT * WHERE U.Age NOT_IN //[(FROM User U SELECT U.Age), 14]//

This example illustrates the usage of partial select statemens within a tuple.
